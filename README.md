# Learners Guild Shared Bookmarks
Phil and I put our bookmarks together to create this shared bookmarks file that we thought would be useful

Import instructions
1. Download the HTML file in this repo
2. Open Chrome
3. Click the "..." in the upper right hand corner of Chrome (the menu)
4. Click "Bookmarks"
5. Click "Import Bookmarks and Settings"
6. Click the dropdown menu and choose "Bookmarks HTML File"
7. Click "Choose File"
8. Select the file you downloaded earlier (lg_bookmarks.html), and press "Open"

Your bookmarks bar shoudl now have a folder called "Imported" which has a folder called "LG Shared".  If you don't see it, go back to the Bookmarks menu in Chrome and click "Show Bookmarks bar".

Voila, and enjoy!
